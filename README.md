# HungerHeal üç≤

**HungerHeal** is a real-time, location-based platform to connect food donors (restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, caterers, individuals) with receivers (NGOs, shelters, volunteers, families in need). The goal is to reduce food waste and help those in need by making surplus food available quickly and safely.

## Features
- **Post Surplus Food:** Donors can post available food with details, contact info, and optional ID verification for credibility.
- **Find Available Food:** Receivers can search for food by address and view posts on an interactive map.
- **Trust Score:** Each post displays a trust score based on provided information and verification, with color-coded markers for quick assessment.
- **Safety Guidelines:** Built-in safety tips for both donors and receivers.
- **Real-Time Countdown:** Each food post shows the time left to claim it, based on expiry.

## How It Works
1. **Donors** fill out a form with food details, contact info, and pickup address. Optionally, they can upload an ID for extra credibility.
2. **Receivers** search for food by entering an address and view available posts on a map.
3. Each post includes all relevant info, trust score, and a countdown timer for how long the food will be available.
